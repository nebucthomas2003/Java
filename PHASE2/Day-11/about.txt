This folder Day-11 and above are based on the Collections topic in Java, which are essentials for learning DSA. If you could concentrate more on
STRING | ARRAYS | COLLECTIONS then DSA will be easy.

Collections are framework for java which helps us to store data in different type of ways. Collections can be divided into

1.List
2.Queue
3.Set

These are the primary topics from which again it wil get splitted.

List 
*****
List can be divided into
                        1.ArrayList
                        2.LinkedList
                        3.Vector
                        4.Stack
            Properties
            **********
            1.They all follow insertion order
            2.They all are Classes
            


            ArrayList
            ---------
            ArrayList are based on arrays. They follow insertion order. Initial capacity is 10 .
            it can be created by three ways.
                                            1. without arguments
                                            2. with arguments
                                            3. with Collections
            It is possible to do all CRUD operations.

            LinkedList
            ----------
            LinkedList are based on arrays. They follow insertion order.They are node containing three parts
            Previous where it store the address of the Previous node, the body where it will store the data, the next where it
            will store address of the next node. it is easy to add, remove, and do CRUD operationsin LinkedList than in array due to its efficiency.

            Vector
            ------
            Vector is a legacy class. It will follow the insertion order and it work exactly as the same.

            Stack
            -----
            The Stack is also a legacy class . It is a chain of vector. It works like Last IN First Out Fashion . 


2.Queue
*********
Queue is an interface which consist of
                                     1. Priority Queue
                                     2. Array Dequeue

                                     The follow First In First Out fashion for adding and removing elements.
                                     Properties
                                     ----------
                                     1.They do not follow insertion order
                                     2.They follow first in first out fashion


                        1-Priority Queue
                        It is a queue which add elements in based on Priority.elements with less value have higher Priority.
                        it has many methods to add and remove elements.

                        2-Array Dequeue
                        It is queue which we can add elements at first or last . it has several methods with CRUD operations.
